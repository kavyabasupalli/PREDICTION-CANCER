 PREDICTION-CANCER
 
 
 Business Problem:
 
Sometimes the biopsy result might indicate a tumor to be Benign (Harmless) but later this tumor may split and spread infecting internal tissues turning into a Malignant tumor (Harmful) hence, predicting the biopsy (FNA) result and predict if a tumor could actual be Malignant (Spreading/Harmful) in the future.





SOURCE DATA INFO : 

The source data is sampled clinical trial findings for the Wisconsin city. The findinds dataset contains the test results of a popular biposy technique called (FNA)Fine Needle Aspirate.

PREPROCESSING THE DATA:

We have  11 variables which are 

Sample code number 

Clump Thickness

Uniformity of Cell Size 

Uniformity of Cell Shape 

Marginal Adhesion 

Single Epithelial Cell Size 

Bare Nuclei

Bland Chromatin 

Normal Nucleoli

Mitoses 
Class 

 
 
 
ANALYSIS :
 
1.We have worked together as a team to perform the  analysis from the inputs taken from Data Mining Class which focused on exploring concepts like machine leraning algorithms.
 
2.Applied modelling techniques such as K-NN modelling, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Ensembling Techniques, Neural Networks.

3.Applied performance tunning and tried Ensemble techniques. also Neural networks to the sampled clinical trial Breast cancer data and plotted the performance metrics (Recall) for all the models.

Therefore, after comparing the Recall scores and  we chose the best model which is the K-nn model or logistic regression model is the best fitting model for our breast cancer data.
