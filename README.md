 PREDICTION-CANCER
 Business Problem:  Sometimes the biopsy result might indicate a tumor to be Benign (Harmless) but later this tumor may split and spread infecting internal tissues turning into a Malignant tumor (Harmful) hence, predicting the biopsy (FNA) result and predict if a tumor could actual be Malignant (Spreading / Harmful) in the future.
 We have worked together as a team to perform the  analysis from the inputs taken from Data Mining Class which focused on exploring concepts like machine leraning algorithms.
